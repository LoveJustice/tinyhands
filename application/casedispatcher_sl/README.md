chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh

The 'install.sh' file installs the casedispatcher_sl and all it dependencies in it own directory 
at application/casedispatcher_sl. It also creates a virtual environment .venv in the same directory.
The project needs a secrets.toml file in the .streamlit directory. This file is not included in the repository.
There should also be a .env file in the root directory of the project.
