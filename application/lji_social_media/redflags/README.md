## Original RedFlag Model (redflag_model.py)

### Overview
This script implements an advanced machine learning pipeline for predicting monitor scores using a stacked ensemble approach. The model combines polynomial features, feature selection, and multiple regression algorithms to create a robust prediction system.

### Key Components

#### Data Processing
- Utilizes pre-split data (train/holdout) from a previous data splitting script
- Works with predefined data columns specified in `claude_prompts.RED_FLAGS`
- Implements feature engineering through polynomial features (degree 2)
- Handles missing values using mean imputation
- Applies standard scaling to normalize features

#### Model Architecture
The pipeline consists of several key stages:
1. **Feature Processing**
   - Polynomial feature generation (degree 2)
   - Mean imputation for missing values
   - Standard scaling of features

2. **Feature Selection**
   - Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
   - Uses SVR with linear kernel as the base estimator
   - Selects top 10 most important features

3. **Stacked Ensemble**
   - First layer:
     - Gradient Boosting Regressor
     - Random Forest Regressor
   - Meta-learner:
     - Support Vector Regression (SVR)

The script is designed to be run as a standalone Python program:
```bash
python redflag_model.py
```

### Dependencies
