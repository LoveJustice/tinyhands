nepal doesn't have address, just po boxes

one row per victim, but not per trafficker, duplicate data for each line
add datetime of when form data is entered, figure out lapse between when form was entered and received

Rules for IRF Entry Form

Prevent form submission in any of the following cases:
    -IRF Number is blank
    -Location is blank
    -Staff Name is blank
    -Date is blank       
    -None of the boxes on page 1 are checked
    -    (red flag boxes or other boxes, such as “2.1 Job”)
    -Either box 6.0 or 7.0 is not checked
    If 6.0 is checked and none of options between 6.1-6.9 are checked
    If 6.9 is checked but the box for what kind of “other” is blank
    If 6.0 is checked and either 6.10 or 6.11 is not checked
    If 7.0 is checked but there is no response for 7.1
    There aren’t any names listed in the grid on page 2
    Role (V or T) is not selected for each name
        (but neither V nor T should be a default value if not selected)
    If box 8.2 is checked but the next question, “Had any name come up before?” does not have either yes or no checked.
        If the response is yes but there isn’t at least one number given
    There is no response to 9.6

Generate warning message that can be overridden before submission in any of the following cases:
    No red flags are checked
    7.0 is checked but none of the options between 7.2 and 7.24 are checked
    Box 8.1, 8.2 or 8.3 is not checked
    None of the boxes between 9.1 and 9.4 are checked
    Staff signature is not on the form
    (Warning messages should be something along the lines of “Are you sure you want to submit this IRF with no red flags checked? If this is how the form was received please call the station to confirm and determine why there were no red flags”)
