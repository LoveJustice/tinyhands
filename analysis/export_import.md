# Technical Debt Analysis: export_import

## Executive Summary

The export_import application contains 25 files with approximately 5189 lines of code. The analysis identified 5 architectural concerns, along with 19 code quality issues including 13 high complexity functions and 6 overly large files. Primary areas of technical debt include lack of a dedicated service layer, insufficient testing infrastructure, multiple high-complexity functions requiring refactoring, several oversized files that should be modularized. 

From a technical debt perspective, this application requires significant refactoring with focus on Implement service layer and Implement Domain-Driven Design principles. 

Overall, the export_import application is a maintenance-requiring component of the system that would benefit substantially from architectural improvements and code refactoring to improve maintainability and reduce technical debt.

## Architecture Analysis

### Architectural Issues

#### Missing tests directory

**Description:** No dedicated tests directory found.

**Impact:** Application may lack proper test coverage.

#### Missing service layer

**Description:** No service layer found to separate business logic from views/models.

**Impact:** Business logic is likely mixed with presentation logic in views or data access in models.

#### Missing custom model managers

**Description:** No custom manager layer to abstract complex queries from models and views.

**Impact:** Complex queries likely embedded in views or scattered across the codebase.

#### Multiple high complexity functions

**Description:** Found 13 functions with high cyclomatic complexity.

**Impact:** Indicates code that is difficult to maintain and test.

#### Multiple large files

**Description:** Found 6 files with excessive line counts.

**Impact:** Indicates poor modularity and separation of concerns.

### Django-Specific Anti-patterns

- Overuse of .values()

### Missing Architectural Components

- tests
- services.py
- managers.py
