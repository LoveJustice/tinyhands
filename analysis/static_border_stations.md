# Technical Debt Analysis: static_border_stations

## Executive Summary

The static_border_stations application contains 24 files with approximately 2968 lines of code. The analysis identified 6 architectural concerns, along with 5 code quality issues including 2 high complexity functions and 3 overly large files. Key strengths include being maintains good function complexity levels. Primary areas of technical debt include lack of a dedicated service layer, business logic embedded in views/models instead of a service layer. 

From a technical debt perspective, this application requires significant refactoring with focus on Implement service layer and Implement Domain-Driven Design principles. 

Overall, the static_border_stations application is a maintenance-requiring component of the system that would benefit substantially from architectural improvements and code refactoring to improve maintainability and reduce technical debt.

### File Type Breakdown

- **py**: 24 files


## Architecture Analysis

### Architectural Issues

#### Missing service layer

**Description:** No service layer found to separate business logic from views/models.

**Impact:** Business logic is likely mixed with presentation logic in views or data access in models.

#### Missing custom model managers

**Description:** No custom manager layer to abstract complex queries from models and views.

**Impact:** Complex queries likely embedded in views or scattered across the codebase.

#### Too many models in a single file

**Description:** Found 8 model classes in models.py.

**Impact:** Indicates potential lack of proper domain separation and modularity.

#### Complex business logic in models

**Description:** Models contain complex methods that should be in a service layer.

**Impact:** Violates separation of concerns, makes testing harder.

#### Complex business logic in views

**Description:** Views contain complex methods that should be in a service layer.

**Impact:** Violates separation of concerns, makes testing harder.

#### Multiple large files

**Description:** Found 3 files with excessive line counts.

**Impact:** Indicates poor modularity and separation of concerns.
