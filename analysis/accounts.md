# Technical Debt Analysis: accounts

## Executive Summary

The accounts application contains 25 files with approximately 1723 lines of code. The analysis identified 5 architectural concerns, along with 1 code quality issues including 0 high complexity functions and 1 overly large files. Key strengths include being maintains good function complexity levels, keeps file sizes manageable. Primary areas of technical debt include lack of a dedicated service layer, business logic embedded in views/models instead of a service layer. 

From a technical debt perspective, this application requires moderate improvements with focus on Standardize view implementations and Implement service layer. 

Overall, the accounts application is a moderate-quality component of the system with some technical debt that should be addressed in the medium term to ensure continued maintainability.

## Architecture Analysis

### Architectural Issues

#### Missing service layer

**Description:** No service layer found to separate business logic from views/models.

**Impact:** Business logic is likely mixed with presentation logic in views or data access in models.

#### Missing custom model managers

**Description:** No custom manager layer to abstract complex queries from models and views.

**Impact:** Complex queries likely embedded in views or scattered across the codebase.

#### Complex business logic in models

**Description:** Models contain complex methods that should be in a service layer.

**Impact:** Violates separation of concerns, makes testing harder.

#### Complex business logic in views

**Description:** Views contain complex methods that should be in a service layer.

**Impact:** Violates separation of concerns, makes testing harder.

#### Mixing function-based and class-based views

**Description:** The application mixes both view styles, which can be confusing.

**Impact:** Inconsistent patterns make code harder to understand and maintain.

### Django-Specific Anti-patterns

- Business logic in models
- Business logic in views
- Mixed view styles

### Missing Architectural Components

- forms.py
- services.py

#### Add type hints to function signatures

**Description:** Add Python type hints to critical functions for better IDE support and documentation.

**Effort:** Small

**Benefits:**
- Improves code clarity
- Reduces bugs
- Better IDE support

### Medium-term Improvements (1-2 quarters)
