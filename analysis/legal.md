# Technical Debt Analysis: legal

## Executive Summary

The legal application contains 15 files with approximately 1298 lines of code. The analysis identified 3 architectural concerns, along with 4 code quality issues including 2 high complexity functions and 2 overly large files. Key strengths include being maintains good function complexity levels, avoids common Django anti-patterns. Primary areas of technical debt include lack of a dedicated service layer, insufficient testing infrastructure. 

From a technical debt perspective, this application requires moderate improvements with focus on Add type hints to function signatures and Implement service layer. 

Overall, the legal application is a moderate-quality component of the system with some technical debt that should be addressed in the medium term to ensure continued maintainability.

## Architecture Analysis

### Architectural Issues

#### Missing tests directory

**Description:** No dedicated tests directory found.

**Impact:** Application may lack proper test coverage.

#### Missing service layer

**Description:** No service layer found to separate business logic from views/models.

**Impact:** Business logic is likely mixed with presentation logic in views or data access in models.

#### Missing custom model managers

**Description:** No custom manager layer to abstract complex queries from models and views.

**Impact:** Complex queries likely embedded in views or scattered across the codebase.

### Django-Specific Anti-patterns

No significant Django anti-patterns identified.

### Missing Architectural Components

- tests
- services.py
- managers.py
